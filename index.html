  <h2>The Cobblestone Enigma</h2>
  <p>**Poem:**</p>
  <p>A line of cobble, stark and lone,<br>
  Across the plains, it makes its home.<br>
  With gaps so neat, a pattern bold,<br>
  A mystery within unfolds.</p>
  <p>Is it a glitch, a player's hand,<br>
  Or something yet we don't understand?</p>
  <p>No guide or map reveals its truth,<br>
  A silent puzzle for our youth.</p>
  <p>**Intriguing Riddle:**</p>
  <p>I stand apart, yet made of stone,<br>
  With gaps between, but not alone.<br>
  No builder claims me, no guide explains,<br>
  My purpose hidden, lost to rains.</p>
  <p>Have players passed, or was I born,<br>
  A secret whispered, never sworn?</p>
  <p>Search far and wide, explore and quest,<br>
  Unlock the truth I hold within my breast.</p>
